### ESGmetric_from_PDF

This package provides a proof-of-concept to show to extract specific ESG metrics (e.g. auditor name, tenure and fees) from PDF files using Natural Language Processing, to improve ESG scoring. 

The code can be adapted to extract any ESG metric from text for example environmental, societal or more governance metrics (SASB, Slavery Act etc.), or it can be adapted to use your own training data to train the model on other documents.
The package is freely available on PyPi here: 

Possible improvements to the code are to differentiate between the audit and non-audit fees, extract values from tables or add sentiment analysis, for example to explore the integrity of the board members.
